**Emotion-Based Mood Prediction using CNN 
Project Overview **
This project aims to detect human emotions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and real-time webcam input. The system analyzes facial expressions and predicts emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral.

The project uses a combination of a custom dataset and an online dataset to train the model. Images are preprocessed and resized to 48×48 grayscale format to ensure efficient training of the CNN model.
